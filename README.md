# RFGR-Extended-Camera
Camera mod for Red Faction Guerrilla Re-mars-tered. Allows for free camera movement across the map, toggling fog, and toggling the HUD. I'm currently focused on my lua script loader project [here](https://github.com/Moneyl/RFGR-Script-Loader-Wiki), so I've uploaded the code for this in case anyone wanted to take a look at it. I'll try to make some small updates to this based on what I learn with the script loader, but most of my efforts will be focused towards that.
