# RFGR-Extended-Camera

Camera mod for Red Faction Guerrilla Re-mars-tered. Allows for free camera movement across the map, toggling fog, and toggling the HUD. The code is outdated and needs refactoring, but it's a relatively small example of how something like this works. A much newer and more bugfree version of this is included in another project, the [RFGR Script Loader](https://github.com/rsl-dev/RSL) which aimed to bring lua scripting and other modding tools to RFGR. It's no longer being developed but still works with the most recent version of RFGR.

If you don't want to build the source yourself, grab the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/Moneyl/RFGR-Extended-Camera/releases) page.
