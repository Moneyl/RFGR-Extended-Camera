Camera mod for Red Faction Guerrilla Re-mars-tered. Allows for free camera movement across the map, toggling fog, and toggling the HUD. The code is outdated and needs refactoring, but it's a smallish example of how something like this works. A much newer and more bugfree version of this is included in my newest project (closed source sadly), the [RFGR Script Loader](https://github.com/Moneyl/RFGR-Script-Loader-Wiki) which aims to bring lua scripting and other modding tools to RFGR. If you have any questions or problems either make a new issue or ask me in the [Official Red Faction Discord](https://discord.gg/RDsQKU8).

If you don't want to build the source yourself, grab the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/Moneyl/RFGR-Extended-Camera/releases) page.
